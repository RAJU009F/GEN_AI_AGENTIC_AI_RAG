    "In this lab, you'll explore the powerful capabilities of tool calling in large language models (LLMs) to build advanced AI agents that can interact with external systems. You'll learn how to create custom tools that enable an LLM to perform specific actions, from extracting video IDs to fetching YouTube transcripts and metadata. Through hands-on examples, you'll first implement manual tool calling to understand the underlying mechanics, then build a flexible YouTube interaction system that can search videos, extract transcripts, fetch trending content, and generate summaries. By the end of this lab, you'll understand how to construct both fixed-sequence and recursive tool-calling chains, allowing your AI assistants to dynamically decide which tools to use and when to use them, creating truly intelligent agents that can reason about and interact with the world around them.\n"

       "'Over the past couple of months, large language models, or LLMs, such as chatGPT, have taken the world by storm. Whether it\\'s writing poetry or helping plan your upcoming vacation, we are seeing a step change in the performance of AI and its potential to drive enterprise value. My name is Kate Soule. I\\'m a senior manager of business strategy at IBM Research, and today I\\'m going to give a brief overview of this new field of AI that\\'s emerging and how it can be used in a business setting to drive value. Now, large language models are actually a part of a different class of models called foundation models. Now, the term \"foundation models\" was actually first coined by a team from Stanford when they saw that the field of AI was converging to a new paradigm. Where before AI applications were being built by training, maybe a library of different AI models, where each AI model was trained on very task-specific data to perform very specific task. They predicted that we were going to start moving to a new paradigm, where we would have a foundational capability, or a foundation model, that would drive all of these same use cases and applications. So the same exact applications that we were envisioning before with conventional AI, and the same model could drive any number of additional applications. The point is that this model could be transferred to any number of tasks. What gives this model the super power to be able to transfer to multiple different tasks and perform multiple different functions is that it\\'s been trained on a huge amount, in an unsupervised manner, on unstructured data. And what that means, in the language domain, is basically I\\'ll feed a bunch of sentences-- and I\\'m talking terabytes of data here --to train this model. And the start of my sentence might be \"no use crying over spilled\" and the end of my sentence might be \"milk\". And I\\'m trying to get my model to predict the last word of the sentence based off of the words that it saw before. And it\\'s this generative capability of the model-- predicting and generating the next word --based off of previous words that it\\'s seen beforehand, that is why that foundation models are actually a part of the field of AI called generative AI because we\\'re generating something new in this case, the next word in a sentence. And even though these models are trained to perform, at its core, a generation past, predicting the next word in the sentence, we actually can take these models, and if you introduce a small amount of labeled data to the equation, you can tune them to perform traditional NLP tasks-- things like classification, or named-entity recognition --things that you don\\'t normally associate as being a generative-based model or capability. And this process is called tuning. Where you can tune your foundation model by introducing a small amount of data, you update the parameters of your model and now perform a very specific natural language task. If you don\\'t have data, or have only very few data points, you can still take these foundation models and they actually work very well in low-labeled data domains. And in a process called prompting or prompt engineering, you can apply these models for some of those same exact tasks. So an example of prompting a model to perform a classification task might be you could give a model a sentence and then ask it a question: Does this sentence have a positive sentiment or negative sentiment? The model\\'s going to try and finish generating words in that sentence, and the next natural word in that sentence would be the answer to your classification problem, which would respond either positive or negative, depending on where it estimated the sentiment of the sentence would be. And these models work surprisingly well when applied to these new settings and domains. Now, this is a lot of where the advantages of foundation models come into play. So if we talk about the advantages, the chief advantage is the performance. These models have seen so much data. Again, data with a capital D-- terabytes of data --that by the time that they\\'re applied to small tasks, they can drastically outperform a model that was only trained on just a few data points. The second advantage of these models are the productivity gains. So just like I said earlier, through prompting or tuning, you need far less label data to get to task-specific model than if you had to start from scratch because your model is taking advantage of all the unlabeled data that it saw in its pre-training when we created this generative task. With these advantages, there are also some disadvantages that are important to keep in mind. And the first of those is the compute cost. So that penalty for having this model see so much data is that they\\'re very expensive to train, making it difficult for smaller enterprises to train a foundation model on their own. They\\'re also expensive-- by the time they get to a huge size, a couple billion parameters --they\\'re also very expensive to run inference. You might require multiple GPUs at a time just to host these models and run inference, making them a more costly method than traditional approaches. The second disadvantage of these models is on the trustworthiness side. So just like data is a huge advantage for these models, they\\'ve seen so much unstructured data, it also comes at a cost, especially in the domain like language. A lot of these models are trained basically off of language data that\\'s been scraped from the Internet. And there\\'s so much data that these models have been trained on. Even if you had a whole team of human annotators, you wouldn\\'t be able to go through and actually vet every single data point to make sure that it wasn\\'t biased and didn\\'t contain hate speech or other toxic information. And that\\'s just assuming you actually know what the data is. Often we don\\'t even know-- for a lot of these open source models that have been posted --what the exact datasets are that these models have been trained on leading to trustworthiness issues. So IBM recognizes the huge potential of these technologies. But my partners in IBM Research are working on multiple different innovations to try and improve also the efficiency of these models and the trustworthiness and reliability of these models to make them more relevant in a business setting. All of these examples that I\\'ve talked through so far have just been on the language side. But the reality is, there are a lot of other domains that foundation models can be applied towards. Famously, we\\'ve seen foundation models for vision --looking at models such as DALL-E 2, which takes text data, and that\\'s then used to generate a custom image. We\\'ve seen models for code with products like Copilot that can help complete code as it\\'s being authored. And IBM\\'s innovating across all of these domains. So whether it\\'s language models that we\\'re building into products like Watson Assistant and Watson Discovery, vision models that we\\'re building into products like Maximo Visual Inspection, or Ansible code models that we\\'re building with our partners at Red Hat under Project Wisdom. We\\'re innovating across all of these domains and more. We\\'re working on chemistry. So, for example, we just published and released molformer, which is a foundation model to promote molecule discovery or different targeted therapeutics. And we\\'re working on models for climate change, building Earth Science Foundation models using geospatial data to improve climate research. I hope you found this video both informative and helpful. If you\\'re interested in learning more, particularly how IBM is working to improve some of these disadvantages, making foundation models more trustworthy and more efficient, please take a look at the links below.

       "'Large language models. They are everywhere. They get some things amazingly right and other things very interestingly wrong. My name\\xa0is Marina Danilevsky. I am a Senior Research Scientist here at IBM Research. And I want\\xa0to tell you about a framework to help large language models be more accurate and more up to\\xa0date: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG. Let\\'s just talk about the \"Generation\" part for a\\xa0minute. So forget the \"Retrieval-Augmented\". So the\\xa0generation, this refers to large language models,\\xa0or LLMs, that generate text in response to a user query, referred to as a prompt. These\\xa0models can have some undesirable behavior. I want to tell you an anecdote to illustrate this. So my kids, they recently asked me this question: \"In our solar system, what planet has the most\\xa0moons?\" And my response was, “Oh, that\\'s really great that you\\'re asking this question. I loved\\xa0space when I was your age.” Of course, that was like 30 years ago. But I know this! I read an\\xa0article and the article said that it was Jupiter and 88 moons. So that\\'s the answer. Now, actually,\\xa0there\\'s a couple of things wrong with my answer. First of all, I have no source to support what\\xa0I\\'m saying. So even though I confidently said “I read an article, I know the answer!”, I\\'m not\\xa0sourcing it. I\\'m giving the answer off the top of my head. And also, I actually haven\\'t kept up with\\xa0this for awhile, and my answer is out of date. So we have two problems here. One is no source.\\xa0And the second problem is that I am out of date.\\xa0\\xa0 And these, in fact, are two behaviors that are\\xa0often observed as problematic when interacting with large language models. They’re LLM\\xa0challenges. Now, what would have happened if I\\'d taken a beat and first gone and looked\\xa0up the answer on a reputable source like NASA? Well, then I would have been able to say, “Ah,\\xa0okay! So the answer is Saturn with 146 moons.” And in fact, this keeps changing because scientists\\xa0keep on discovering more and more moons. So I have now grounded my answer in something more\\xa0\\nbelievable. I have not hallucinated or made up an answer. Oh, by the way, I didn\\'t leak personal\\xa0information about how long ago it\\'s been since I was obsessed with space. All right, so what does\\xa0this have to do with large language models? Well, how would a large language model have answered\\xa0this question? So let\\'s say that I have a user asking this question about moons. A large language\\xa0model would confidently say, OK, I have been trained and from what I know in my parameters\\xa0during my training, the answer is Jupiter. The answer is wrong. But, you know, we don\\'t know. The large language model is very confident in what it answered. Now, what happens when you add this\\xa0retrieval augmented part here? What does that mean? That means that now, instead of just relying\\xa0on what the LLM knows, we are adding a content store. This could be open like the internet. This\\xa0can be closed like some collection of documents, collection of policies, whatever. The point,\\xa0though, now is that the LLM first goes and talks to the content store and says,\\xa0“Hey, can you retrieve for me information that is relevant to what the user\\'s\\xa0query was?” And now, with this retrieval-augmented answer, it\\'s not Jupiter anymore. We know that\\xa0it is Saturn. What does this look like? Well, first user prompts the LLM\\xa0with their question. They say, this is what my question was. And originally,\\xa0if we\\'re just talking to a generative model, the generative model says, “Oh, okay, I know\\xa0the response. Here it is. Here\\'s my response.”\\xa0\\xa0 But now in the RAG framework, the generative\\xa0model actually has an instruction that says, \"No, no, no.\" \"First, go and retrieve\\xa0relevant content.\" \"Combine that with the user\\'s question and only then generate the\\xa0answer.\" So the prompt now has three parts: the instruction to pay attention to, the retrieved\\xa0content, together with the user\\'s question. Now give a response. And in fact, now you can give\\xa0evidence for why your response was what it was.\\xa0\\xa0 So now hopefully you can see, how does RAG help the two LLM challenges that I had mentioned before?\\xa0\\xa0 So first of all, I\\'ll start with the out of\\xa0date part. Now, instead of having to retrain your model, if new information comes up, like, hey,\\xa0we found some more moons-- now to Jupiter again, maybe it\\'ll be Saturn again in the future. All\\xa0you have to do is you augment your data store with new information, update information. So now the next time that a user comes and asks the question, we\\'re ready. We just go ahead and retrieve the most up to date information. The second problem, source. Well, the large language model is now being instructed to pay attention to primary source data before giving its response. And in fact, now being able to give evidence. This makes it less likely to hallucinate or to leak data because it is less likely to rely only on information that it learned during training. It also allows us to get the model to have a behavior that can be very positive, which is knowing when to say, “I don\\'t know.” If\\xa0the user\\'s question cannot be reliably answered based on your data store, the model should say,\\xa0\"I don\\'t know,\" instead of making up something that is believable and may mislead the user. This\\xa0can have a negative effect as well though, because if the retriever is not sufficiently\\xa0good to give the large language model the best, most high-quality grounding information, then\\xa0maybe the user\\'s query that is answerable doesn\\'t get an answer. So this is actually why lots\\xa0of folks, including many of us here at IBM, are working the problem on both sides. We are both\\xa0working to improve the retriever to give the large language model the best quality data on which\\xa0to ground its response, and also the generative part so that the LLM can give the richest, best\\xa0response finally to the user when it generates the answer. Thank you for learning more about RAG\\xa0and like and subscribe to the channel. Thank you.'"
